# Student Performance Analytics – QA Assignment

This repository contains the coursework for the Software Quality Assurance module.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing student performance by calculating average marks and classifying performance levels. Quality assurance techniques such as control flow graphs, cyclomatic complexity, test case design, and test management tools are applied.

## Repository Structure
- Task1: Algorithm, control flow graph, and complexity analysis
- Task2: Test planning, test cases, and TestMonitor evidence
- Task3: Software quality, risks, and mitigation strategies

## Tools Used
- Python (for algorithm implementation)
- TestMonitor (for test case management)
- GitHub (for version control and documentation)
